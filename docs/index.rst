NMR-EsPy (**N**\ uclear **M**\ agnetic **R**\ esonance **Es**\ timation in
**Py**\ thon) is a Python package for the estimation of parameters that
describe NMR signals.

As with the majority of packages that do a lot of number crunching in Python,
NMR-EsPy relies heavily on `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_ as well as
`SciPy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_ routines to function efficiently.

The NMR-EsPy package is a product of work carried out during my Ph.D
within the group of Dr. Mohammadali Foroozandeh, in the University of
Oxford's Chemistry Department. To find out more about the group, take a look
at our `website. <http://foroozandeh.chem.ox.ac.uk/home>`_

.. The following publications are directly linked to NMR-EsPy and provide
.. an extensive background on the underlying theory and examples of results
.. obtained by using it:
